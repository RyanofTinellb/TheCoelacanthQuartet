            <h1 id="waterfall">Waterfall</h1>
<p>When Tussol, head of the Department of Intercultural Relations at Lusov University, reached his office that morning, he found Lharen already waiting outside. He bade her wait for a few moments longer while he set himself up inside.</p>
<p>He called her in. &ldquo;Citizen Belak, is it?&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Our records show that you were a student here, but left before the conclusion of your studies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt a flash of some negative emotion from her before she quashed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Professor. I was studying to become a scribe with that department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinarily, your departure would leave you incapable of gaining your qualification at any future date, but circumstances seem to have changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flash this time was of curiosity, which he had expected. After all, he had been surprised himself when his directions had filtered down the university hierarchy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The village of Tsentsen has requested your presence to cover a shortfall of theirs. A scribe has unexpectedly fallen ill, and they have been unable to find a replacement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lharen recognised the name &mdash; this was Toresh&rsquo;s home. This could not be coincidence; Toresh and her father had returned only two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizen, these unique circumstances have given us no choice. As ambassadors between us and the Fezhl&ecirc; must have at least a doctorate, it has been decided to give you an honorary certificate of completion. Your conduct while with the toplanders will be taken into consideration when deciding whether to allow you to keep that qualification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As quick as that, Lharen was reassigned, and walking up the corridor with a packet of papers in her hand. Still in a daze from the morning&rsquo;s events, she didn&rsquo;t realise there was anyone else there until they had already collided. Two sets of belongings scattered on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ms. Belak? You&rsquo;re Fieran&rsquo;s sister, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at the sound of her name. Green eyes stared back at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only ask because we used to go to school together. Then he joined the peacekeepers and I came here. It&rsquo;s a nice coincidence to run into both of you in the same week. It must be good to have him back in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back? Fieran&rsquo;s back?&rdquo; Lharen&rsquo;s life had also diverged from her brother&rsquo;s, but unlike with this person, contact between the siblings had been minimal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, yeah. He&rsquo;s been posted back to Lusov. Look, can I get you a coffee as an apology for knocking into you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one who should apologise. I was quite distracted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok, then. You can buy me a drink. I&rsquo;m Vedran, by the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lead her down the corridor to the eatery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, &rdquo; he said, once they had collected their beverages. &ldquo;What brings you here today? You&rsquo;re getting past the usual age of the students, and you don&rsquo;t look like an academic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew the answer already; obviously this was a conversational gambit. Lharen even started wondering if their running into each other was actually a coincidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite odd being back, that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; Lharen deliberately avoided the &#x8cea;&#x554f;.</p>
