<p>When Tussol, head of the Faculty of Intercultural Relations at Lusov University, reached his office that morning, he found Lharen already waiting outside. He bade her wait for a few moments longer while he set himself up inside.</p>
<p>He called her in. &ldquo;Citizen Kintel, is it?&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Our records show that you were a student here, but left before the conclusion of your studies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt a flash of negative emotion from her before she seemed to quash it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Professor. I was studying to become a scribe with that department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinarily, your departure would leave you incapable of gaining your qualification at any future date, but circumstances seem to have changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flash this time was of curiosity, which he had expected. After all, he had been surprised when his directions had filtered down the university hierarchy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The village of Tsentsen has requested your presence to cover a shortfall of theirs. A scribe has unexpectedly fallen ill, and they have been unable to find a replacement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lharen recognised the name &mdash; this was Toresh&rsquo;s home. This could not be coincidence; Toresh and her father had returned only two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizen, these unique circumstances have given us no choice. As ambassadors between us and the Fezhel must have at least a doctorate, it has been decided to give you an honorary certificate of completion. Your conduct while with the toplanders will be taken into consideration when deciding whether to allow you to keep that qualification.&rdquo;</p>
